# MujocoTutorial
[中文](./README-ZH.md)
This rep hopes to introduce the robot simulator Mujoco in detail. First of all, it may be necessary to use the emulator in the postgraduate study, but Mujoco itself is very complicated, and there is no good tutorial library, so it brings great difficulties to learning. The second is to hope to gradually learn more about Mujoco and continuously learn robot-related knowledge to improve their abilities. Of course, at present, I only have a preliminary understanding of the Mujoco simulator. So first use markdown to write a concise tutorial, and then continue to improve as you learn.

(Because my native language is Chinese, there will be a Chinese version maintained first.[Here中文版本](./README-ZH.md))
